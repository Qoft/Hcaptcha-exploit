# WARNING
This exploit has already been reported to hcaptcha by me (qoft). This will probably not be working for long.
#


## Usage
- Update `hcaptcha.com` to `staging.hmt.ai` inside your code.
- Also urlencode the sitekey in the request paramters.
- Send a request to getcaptcha and it'l return images with the type inside the url.

Speeds can be improved by changing the language of the actual solver.
